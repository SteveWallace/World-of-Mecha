####A game by Steve Wallace

###Stats 
Mechs have 3 stats, pilots also have 3 stats. Combined these make up the 6 stats you will use throughout the game.

**Mecha** Power, Speed, Metal
**Pilot** Physical, Social, Intellect


Power is the amount of strength or might that a mecha has. How much damage they can do.

Speed is how fast a mecha can move. 

Metal is how large your mecha is and how much damage it can do and how many hard points (mounts) it will have.

Physical is your pilots physical strength and toughness.

Social is your pilots ability to get along with others.

Intellect is your pilots smarts.

###Building your Mecha
When building your mech you start with 1 build slot per stat. Additional slots can be opened with advancements.
You can equip one package per slot. Packages can only be assigned to build slots attached to their key skill. So power packages can only be assigned to the power slot.
